# WiNDC Datastream V3.0.0
Data processing tools that generate the input GDX used to build the core WiNDC database.

This is an updated version of the build stream built using a class structure. 

The raw data is located at [the WiNDC homepage](https://windc.wisc.edu/data_stream.html). Currently this code can load V3.0.0 and V2.1 of the raw data.
